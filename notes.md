- Molecules as sensitive probes of the ISM
- What do molecules tell us?
  - Cosmic microwave background, leftover radiation from big bang
  - Imaging for dynamics
  - Building blocks of life
- What are some really interesting molecules to find?
  - Amino acids are interesting, but not sufficient
  - Quirky molecules that are too reactive to be found terrestrially
- An incredibly common motif that was not found in space until recently is aromaticity
  - Benzonitrile; benzene was reported but needs very loving eyes
  - So why benzonitrile?
- How do we detect molecules?
  - Molecules need a dipole moment, permanent or induced
  - Radio observations give a unique window into space
  - Vast majority of molecules found in space detected in the radio
- Observe transitions between rotational levels of molecules
  - Show rotational spectra for a small prolate top and a big molecule
- What are the requirements?
  - Good laboratory data
  - Big telescopes that give you both coverage and sensitivity
  - Automation to analyze it all
- Lab
  - Need accurate *and* precise catalogs to find molecules
  - The experiment is simple: Fourier transform microwave spectroscopy, both cavity enhanced and broadband chirped pulse with jet-cooled molecules
  - Couple to electrical discharge to initiate reactions between stable precursors
- Examples of some of the molecules we've studied
  - HSCCH, made by discharging HCCH + H2S
  - SiH3CN, made by discharging SiH4 with CH3CN
  - GeC6, made by ablating Germanium and carbon together
- Perhaps more powerful methodology was to adopt unbiased reaction assays
